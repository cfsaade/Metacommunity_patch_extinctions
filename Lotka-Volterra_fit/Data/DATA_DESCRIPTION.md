# density_data.csv
A table with the densities of each species over time in single patch culture. Values in columns:

- "file": the name of the video sample used for species count and identification, serves as a unique identificator for each tube
- "date": date at which the sample was taken (yyyy-mm-dd)
- "time": the time of day at which the sample was taken (hour)
- "magnification": magnification setting of the microscope during video acquisition
- "community": the species grown in a tube
- "replicate": the replicate number
- "measure_point": the number of the measurement (t0 to t11)
- "Tet": the density (individuals/mL) of Tetrahymena thermophila
- "Pca": the density (individuals/mL) of Paramecium caudatum (a species initially considered in the pilot, not used in the final study)
- "Col": the density (individuals/mL) of Colpidium sp.
- "Ble": the density (individuals/mL) of Blepharisma sp.
- "Ble_shadow": density of particles identified as the shadow of a Blepharisma sp. individual (indiv/mL)
- "hours": the time passed since the begining of the culture (in hours)
